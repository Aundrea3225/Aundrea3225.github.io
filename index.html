<p> Hello! My name is Aundrea Adams and I am a senior at The University of Tennessee at Martin. I am a communications major with a focus in broadcasting, and a theatre minor. My aspiration in life is to become a Sports Sideline Reporter. I am a former athlete, so I love all sports, & know them pretty well. I transferred to The University of Tennessee at Martin my junior year on a full athletic scholarship. I transferred from Northeast Mississippi Community College in Boonville, MS. I decided not to play basketball my last year in college, so I could focus more on my career. Being a college athlete takes up so much time and I never had time to explore and intern. </p>
<p>Although I have little to none experience in my future field, I can assure you that I am ready to learn. I picked this field because I love sports, and I love to talk. As a reporter, the most important attribute is curiosity. I have been curious since I was a child. My grandparents use to call me “Chatty Kathy” because I asked the question “why?” so much and talked all of the time. </p>
<p>I decided to stick with sports since that is something that I am familiar with, but I am okay if I have to start with news, weather, or even radio. I have always been taught that you have to start somewhere, and I am willing to start wherever I am needed.</p>
<p>Some of the relevant courses that I have taken are Intro to Media Design/Public Relations, Intro to Broadcasting, Intro to Media Writing, Broadcast Media Writing, Interpersonal Communication, & Communication Law & Ethics. I have also had the opportunity to work on the WUTM 90.3 The Hawk Radio. I have done many interviews along with the transcripts for class projects. I have also done radio commercials and air checks.</p>
<p>I am a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, which I dedicate most of my time to. During my spare time, I enjoy hanging out with my line sisters and my dearest friend Blu whom is my pet bulldog. Amongst other things I also enjoy reading. My favorite place to go get lunch is Yamoto’s, which I eat at least once a week on the days I decide not to cook. I do not enjoy cooking honestly, but my mom has always told me I have to learn in order to get a good husband one day. My favorite show to binge watch is Grey’s Anatomy even though I have watched each season over five times. </p>
<p>I truly believe I would be considered a great candidate for this position. I work hard and I have always believed that if you stay true to yourself, push yourself, and work hard you can do whatever you put your mind to. I am a very fast learner, and I am also eager to learn. Also, I have never been afraid to ask for help. Beyond sports, competitiveness is in my genes. I tend to be hard on myself, but over the years I have learned to remain positive and things will work out. </p>
